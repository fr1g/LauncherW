# LauncherW
 Electron Crash Minecraft Launcher base on [ProjBobCat](https://github.com/Corona-Studio/ProjBobcat/). Full name is LauncherWebUI.

This project got a UI that looks like LauncherX's

(but much more is what my design)

the Basement ProjBobCat is a powerful C# Minecraft Launcher Core. 

Later I may send this repo to Corona Studio(if the rest of them don't hate my kurwa)

and, I forgot lots of usage of js...

- projbobcat
- electronjs
- tailwindcss
